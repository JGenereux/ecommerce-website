# Basic Ecommerce website for client built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js)

# Payment's are handled using the Stripe API allowing for a smooth and secure checkout.

# TODO

- add oauth(to allow users to see past purchases)
- contact form
- clean up the ui design (css is tricky ok)
