# Heartland Shoppes Ecommerce Website

This website was built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js).

Payments are handled using the Stripe API, ensuring smooth and secure checkout processes.

Currently, the website is hosted at https://ecommerce-website-client.vercel.app/. There are still many functionalities to add and optimizations to make, particularly improving API call efficiency. I plan to continue working on this codebase in the future.

Currently, the website is designed for desktop users only. The CSS is organized into one large file without any CSS frameworks/libraries, which has slowed down the build process. I intend to refactor this for better efficiency.
