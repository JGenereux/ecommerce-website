      <p className="about-description">
        I decided in October 2017, that I wanted to get back into crafting. It
        has changed a lot and the possibilities are endless. I have called my
        shop Heartlandshoppes as I want to help people celebrate moments in
        their lives. Made from the heart. I have a lot of new ideas coming to my
        Heartlandshoppes so stay tuned. Iâ€™m very excited about what is to come.
        I am leaning toward family heirlooms. If you have a design idea in mind,
        ask: I maybe able to get it done for you. I enjoy the process of
        creating from start to the finish.
